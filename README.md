# 🧠 BotDetector

**BotDetector** is a captcha solver detection system that determines whether a captcha is solved by a **human** or a **bot**. By analyzing behavioral biometrics and leveraging deep learning, BotDetector aims to enhance CAPTCHA security through anomaly detection and behavioral analysis — going beyond just checking if the solution is correct.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional CAPTCHA systems are no longer reliable. Bots powered by advanced ML models can now solve text-based CAPTCHAs with high accuracy, making correctness alone an insufficient measure of human verification.

🔒 A better approach should:
- Validate the **solution**, and  
- Analyze **how** the user arrives at it.

💡 This project explores both the **attack vector** (bot solving captchas) and the **defense mechanism** (detecting automated solvers using behavioral biometrics and anomaly detection).

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Captures user interactions while solving captchas using a **Flask-based web interface**.
- Uses an **LSTM Autoencoder** trained on human behavior to flag bot-like actions as anomalies.
- Simulates bot behavior via:
  - Random mouse movements
  - Timed keystrokes
  - OCR-based captcha solving using a **CNN model**
- Frontend is built using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive UI.

## 📊 Data Collection

To build a robust model for detecting non-human behavior, we collected **2,000+ CAPTCHA solving sessions** from **20+ real participants**, capturing fine-grained behavioral data during each interaction.

We recorded:
- 🖱 **Mouse Coordinates**  
  Tracked continuously to analyze movement smoothness, path variance, and reaction time.
- ⌨️ **Keystroke Events**  
  Logged every key press/release along with timestamps, including usage of backspace to detect natural corrections.
- ⏱ **Timestamps**  
  Captured time per character, total session time, and inter-event delays to model decision-making pace.
- 🔡 **Final Typed Response**  
  Compared with actual CAPTCHA values to validate correctness and analyze error tendencies.

These features were critical for:

- Training an **LSTM Autoencoder** on genuine human behavior patterns.
- Setting **anomaly detection thresholds** using reconstruction error distributions.
- Simulating and distinguishing **realistic vs bot-like interactions**.

With this multi-dimensional dataset, we created a behavioral fingerprint for every session—enabling precise and interpretable detection of automated activity.

## 💡 How It Works

### 👤 Human Behavior Detection
- Tracks **mouse coordinates**, **keypresses**, and **timing** during captcha solving.
- Trains an **LSTM Autoencoder** on normal (human) behavior.
- At inference time, calculates reconstruction error — high error implies anomalous (bot) behavior.

### 🤖 Bot Simulation
- Programmatically simulates user actions with:
  - Noisy/randomized mouse movement paths
  - Fixed or abnormal timing for typing
- Uses a CNN-based **OCR model** to read captcha images and solve them.

### 🧠 OCR Captcha Solver
- Custom **CNN model** trained to recognize alphanumeric characters from captchas.
- Dataset used: [`Kaggle - Captcha Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parsasam/captcha-dataset)
